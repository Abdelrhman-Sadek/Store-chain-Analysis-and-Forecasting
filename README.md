# Store-chain-Analysis-and-Forecasting
**This is a complete Time_Series store chain analysis the goal was to determine:
<br/>
. products at each store of the chain and there promotion at a given date.
<br/>
. which product family have the most and least sales.
<br/>
. which store have the most and least sales
<br/>
. which (city, state, type) have the most and least sales. 
<br/>
. the trned and seasonalty of the time series and how the data changes over time(weekly,monthly,daily,etc)
<br/>
. the relationship between sales and (Holidays(Local,Regional),Oil Price) and how big they effects the sales.
<br/>
. the relationship bettween the time lags  
<br/>
. How many shop visitors in each day(transactions) and how it effects the sales 
<br/>
then use this informations and train a Hybrid model of Liner Regression and CatBoostRegressor to forecast test_detaset(16 day) of sales for each product family in every store
<br/>
<br/>
the acc of the Hybrid model is pretty good (a round 99%)**
